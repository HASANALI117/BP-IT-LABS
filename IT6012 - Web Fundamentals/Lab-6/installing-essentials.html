      Install plumbing fixtures as necessary. Install the bathtub, shower
      enclosure, and any other large plumbing fixtures which will interface with
      finished walls. Make sure plumbing rough-ins are correctly located, and
      pipes are protected and securely anchored.

      Install the wall board or paneling on interior walls. Traditionally,
      builders will use gypsum wallboard, wood, or masonite paneling for this
      purpose. Panels are generally jacked 3/8 inch (1.0 cm) above the floor to
      avoid moisture from floor spills and regular mopping when you clean the
      house. There are many interior wall products available, so the
      installation process will depend on the material used. Apply finish to
      gypsum wallboard, taping and skimming/floating all joints to an acceptable
      level of finish. Finish/texture any ceilings during this step if
      applicable.

      Place wall trim. Put up any trim you are using for baseboards, crown
      mouldings, and corners, and install your interior doors and jambs. If you
      are using natural wood trim and mouldings, you will want to paint the
      walls prior to this step. Pre-finishing the trim before installing will
      make the final finish easier, but any nail-holes will probably still need
      attention after installation.

      Caulk, paint, and install wall coverings on any walls that require it.
      Most likely, you will want to prime wallboard, then apply a finish coat.
      Use a paint roller where possible, cutting-in with brushes around
      appurtenances and in corners. Be sure to trim out the electrical devices,
      install lights and other fixtures, and install breakers in panel boxes if
      they were not pre-installed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install cabinets and other mill work. You will probably need at least
      basic kitchen storage cabinets and a bathroom vanity cabinet for a sink,
      other cabinets may include a bar, upper storage cabinets, and lower units
      with drawers for kitchen utensils and supplies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install flooring. Note that for carpet floors, base boards are installed
      prior to flooring, leaving 3/8 inch (1.0 cm) for the carpet to tuck
      underneath it. For hardwood or composite floors, this trim is installed
      after the floor is finished.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install appliances and have the utilities turned on. To start checking to
      make sure everything is working appropriately, activate the water and
      electricity to start experimenting with your handiwork. Adjust the jobs as
      necessary and work on finishing the house to a state at which you'll want
      to move in and start enjoying your new home.
