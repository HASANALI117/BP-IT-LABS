      <strong>Select a desirable place for your house.</strong> There are many
      factors to consider when finding a suitable location on which to build
      your home. Think about a place you'd like to live long-term and keep in
      mind things like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Climate.</strong> Special considerations must be made for
        building in flood, hurricane, intense heat, frigid cold, and other
        extreme weather and climatic conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ground stability.</strong> Houses built on shifting sand, mucky
        soil, or other unstable earth will likely fail over a short period of
        time unless they are built on special foundations or pilings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability of utilities.</strong> If you intend to have
        electric power, potable water, telephone, and other conveniences, make
        sure these utility providers offer them at your location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community infrastructure.</strong> If you plan to raise children
        or have kids, make sure good quality schools are available. Check to see
        if you are in a police jurisdiction to protect you from crime, look at
        the distance you will have to travel to acquire basic commodities, and
        whether medical help is nearby.
      </li>
    </ul>

      This may be a hurdle, depending on the cost, and your available funds.
      Building a house is an expensive process, but purchasing suitable property
      is also a major investment just as important as homebuilding. Decide how
      you're going to pay for your building project going forward and start that
      process with the land. Some home builders will elect to get a construction
      loan to purchase the land and secure funding for the building project.
      This requires that you enter into a contract with a builder or a
      contractor, and the loan must reference that builder's resume and serve as
      a contract between you and the builder, as well as a source of funding for
      the project. To do this, you'll need to wait until you've hired and vetted
      a builder before purchasing the land.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Have the property surveyed and the footprint of the house
        located.</strong
      >
      This is not absolutely necessary, especially if you are building on a
      large parcel of land, but if there is any doubt about the property lines,
      have this done to assure you are not encroaching on a neighbor's property,
      or the city's. This will be useful as you move forward with the building
      process.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Consider access issues.</strong> On large parcels, especially, you
      will need to ascertain the route for a usable driveway if you depend on a
      car for transportation. Look at any low area that would become impassable
      in winter mud or heavy summer rain, how installing driveway will affect
      the landscape, and whether a driveway will be in conflict with underground
      utilities. Pay particular attention to the way surface water will drain
      off the property. Every effort should be made so that water drains off and
      away from the driveway. This may require the placement of culverts or
      pipes under the driveway to avoid puddling along its sides.
