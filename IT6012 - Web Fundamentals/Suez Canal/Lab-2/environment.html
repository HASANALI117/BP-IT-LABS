    <h1>The Suez Canal: Environmental Impact</h1>

    <h3>Tidal Flow</h3>
    <p class="first">
      The opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the
      Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Although the Red Sea is about 1.2 m (4 ft)
      higher than the eastern Mediterranean,the current between the
      Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the Bitter Lakes flows north
      in winter and south in summer. The current south of the Bitter Lakes is
      tidal, varying with the tide at Suez.
    </p>

    <h3>Invasive Species</h3>
    <p class="second">
      The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the
      migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but
      as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea
      the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red
      Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is
      generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea
      species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and
      nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species
      invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite.
    </p>

    <h3>Effects</h3>
    <p class="third">
      Invasive species originated from the Red Sea and introduced into the
      Mediterranean by the canal have become a major component of the
      Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology,
      endangering many local and endemic species. About 300 species from the Red
      Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and there are probably
      others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the
      canal has raised concerns from marine biologists, fearing that this will
      worsen the invasion of Red Sea species. Also impacting the eastern
      Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of Aswan High Dam
      across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the
      project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural
      nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the Nile Delta.
      This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended
      the higher levels of natural turbidity, additionally making conditions
      more like those in the Red Sea.
