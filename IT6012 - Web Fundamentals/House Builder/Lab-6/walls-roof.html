      Frame the walls of your house. You will need to lay out the wall lines on
      the floor, beginning at one corner, marking your bottom plate (called the
      rat sill) to attach to anchor bolts. As you work, mark the location of
      doors, windows, and interior wall corners on the sill. Be sure to use
      special metal connectors/straps at the floor and tops of walls as required
      by code for storm and earthquake proofing. Use tees at wall intersections,
      substantial headers for openings in load bearing walls, and allow space at
      each rough opening for the feature to be installed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plumb the walls and brace them securely. Install sheathing if required.
      Otherwise, use sheet metal straps to diagonally brace all exterior wall
      corners. Make sure all studs (vertical framing members, usually 2 inch by
      4 inch (5 cm by 10 cm) nominal lumber, graded standard or better) are
      securely nailed in place, straight and square to the wall line.
    </p>

      Lay out the marks for setting your roof trusses. You may want to stick
      frame your roof, cutting and installing rafters and ceiling joists
      yourself (especially if you want a usable attic space). Prefab trusses,
      however, are engineered with lighter, smaller lumber for maximum strength.
      There are some trusses for attics with high-pitched roofs and dormers, as
      well as more traditional roofs. Research your options and choose something
      that works well for your home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Set each truss in the correct location. Generally, this means 24 inches
      (61.0 cm) apart from one another, sometimes 16 inches (40.6 cm) for
      stick-bracing structures. Attach hurricane clips or other connectors to
      secure them, plumb the center of each truss, and temporarily support them
      with a rat run bracing near the peak. Install diagonal gable bracing for a
      roof with gable ends to prevent the roof frame from leaning when you
      install the roof decking. For a hip roof, install king rafters and hip
      rafters, being careful to keep the adjacent plane of the roof consistent
      and straight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nail a sub-facia board to connect the ends of each rafter. Build
      outlookers to support the gable overhang and gable facia boards, if used.
      Deck the trusses or rafters with plywood, oriented strand lumber, or
      nominal lumber such as 1 x 6 inch (2.5 cm x 15 cm) tongue and groove
      boards. In areas where high winds or snow-loading (accumulation) is
      possible, make sure the roof decking is secured and structurally able to
      withstand these severe forces and conditions. Use appropriate bracing and
      fasteners for this scope of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install roofing felt for use as a moisture barrier. To make sure the
      elements don't set you back as you're working, it's important to install a
      moisture barrier on your roof even before it's completed. Use 15 or 30
      pound (6.8 or 13.8 kg) roofing felt tar paper and simplex nails, roofing
      tacks, or plastic capped felting tacks to secure it. Begin felting the
      decking at the lower edge, allowing it to hang over slightly, and overlap
      subsequent layers to keep water from getting under this moisture barrier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install the exterior siding and exterior features such as windows and
      doors. Many locations require some type of metal flashing to prevent water
      from penetrating the edges and the gables, but you may be able to seal
      them sufficiently with caulking if it is permitted and you are able.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install your final roof. You may choose painted sheet metal panels, rolled
      steel formed to lengths needed on site, or shingles, terra cotta tiles, or
      other materials, depending on your preference, costs, and products
      available at your location. Consider ridge vents, attic exhaust fans,
      vented dormers, and other architectural details which can increase the
      comfort of your house while decreasing cooling costs in hot climates.
