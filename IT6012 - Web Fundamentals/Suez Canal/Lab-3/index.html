    <h1>The Suez Canal</h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p class="first">
      The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting
      the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. It was
      constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869, after 10
      years of construction, it was officially opened on November 17, 1869. The
      canal offers watercraft a shorter journey between the North Atlantic and
      northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas by avoiding the
      South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, in turn reducing the journey by
      approximately 7,000 kilometres (4,300 mi). It extends from the northern
      terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city
      of Suez. Its length is 193.30 km (120.11 mi), including its northern and
      southern access channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (47
      per day). The canal is a single-lane waterway with passing locations in
      the Ballah Bypass and the Great Bitter Lake. It contains no locks system,
      with seawater flowing freely through it. In general, the canal north of
      the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. South of the
      lakes, the current changes with the tide at Suez.

    <h3>Ownership</h3>
    <p class="second">
      The canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority[4] (SCA) of
      Egypt. Under the Convention of Constantinople, it may be used "in time of
      war as in time of peace, by every vessel of commerce or of war, without
      distinction of flag.
    </p>

    <h3>Expansion</h3>
    <p class="third">
      In August 2014, construction was launched to expand and widen the Ballah
      Bypass for 35 km (22 mi) to speed the canal's transit time. The expansion
      was planned to double the capacity of the Suez Canal from 49 to 97 ships a
      day.[6] At a cost of $8.4 billion, this project was funded with
      interest-bearing investment certificates issued exclusively to Egyptian
      entities and individuals. The "New Suez Canal", as the expansion was
      dubbed, was opened with great fanfare in a ceremony on 6 August 2015.[7]
      On 24 February 2016, the Suez Canal Authority officially opened the new
      side channel. This side channel, located at the northern side of the east
      extension of the Suez Canal, will serve East Terminal for berthing and
      unberthing vessels from the terminal anytime of day and night. East
      Container Terminal is located in the Suez Canal itself; before
      constructing the new side channel, as long as the Suez Canal convoy was
      running, there was no chance for vessels to berth or unberth at East
      Terminal.
