      Design your own home, or consult an architect. Architects and engineers
      have special training and years of experience in designing houses, and are
      necessary for most building and zoning jurisdiction code requirements.
      Regardless of whether you contract their services or elect to design your
      own, the house you build will be built for you, so you should be involved
      closely in the design process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you hire or consult an architect, find out what management services
      the firm may or may not provide. Some architecture firms will help hire
      contractors they know and trust, as well as consult and inspect the
      contractor's work as it progresses, making necessary revisions and
      additions as the work progresses. This can be a significant headache
      relief in the process.[2] Before building, you'll need to submit plans to
      the city or county building commission for approval. Unless you're an
      experienced architect, it'll be very difficult to produce the necessary
      to-scale production drawings and engineering specs necessary for approval.
      To save time, energy, and money, it's recommended that you consult a
      professional and work alongside them to design the home you want.

      Design the living spaces. The fun part of designing a home is imagining
      your new life in your new space. Spend some time researching pre-drawn
      floor plans for inspiration and consider using them as a guide for your
      own space. Home building guides are commonly available for free online.[3]
      Give lots of thought to what kind of rooms you want, the number of
      bedrooms that will be necessary for your family, and what sort of a style
      you want in the rooms you'll be spending the most time in. Bedrooms: For a
      family house where the possibility of additions exists, remember it is
      simpler to add a room during initial construction than to remodel or build
      an addition later. If you only need 2 bedrooms at present, an extra room
      might be used for an office, storage, or even left unfinished and
      unfurnished until such time as it is needed. Bathrooms: In practical
      terms, one bathroom can suffice in almost any circumstances, but if the
      house is for multiple people, two makes life much easier. Having two or
      more bathrooms will also increase the resale value in the convenience
      minded home buyer's mind.

      Special function rooms: Consider if your lifestyle requires rooms suitable
      for special functions, such as formal dining, office space, a den, or a
      play room.

      Design the utility areas with an eye toward function. For family life,
      having a laundry room, and possibly even a garage can be a real help in
      managing day to day chores. Planning out the necessary house-running
      spaces is a critical part of the design process. It's also important to
      design them to be as easy-to-wire and outfit with plumbing as possible,
      making it important to consult an architectural engineer when designing
      the home. Carefully design your:

    <ul>
      <li>Kitchen</li>
      <li>Garage</li>
      <li>Laundry room</li>
      <li>Storage areas</li>
    </ul>

      Place windows with the maximum energy efficiency in mind. Part aesthetics
      and part energy-efficiency, designing your home with an eye toward
      sunlight will ensure that your home stays full of warm radiant light when
      it needs it the most. If you are building a home with large windows in a
      living room, consider facing these toward the most appealing view and at
      an angle that maximizes the natural lighting when you'll want it most.[4]
      Kitchens may benefit the most from exterior light, so think about what
      time a ray of sunshine in the kitchen will offer the best results. Late
      afternoon may be cooking and dish washing time, so it may be best to
      orient the kitchen towards the west to take advantage. Larger windows on
      the south face of your house will also help heat the house through solar
      gain in colder climates.

      Prepare to tackle water drainage issues with the proper design. Be aware
      of how surface water (rain, snow melt, drainage from seasonal springs)
      moves across the building site. It is critical to keep water away from
      your home, especially in colder climates. Freezing pipes and foundation
      damage can result from a failure to plan at this stage. You want to keep
      your basement dry and lessen the chance that you will have damp wood,
      which invites termites in any climate. Simple swales or grassy ditches
      will go a long way in controlling surface water drainage.
