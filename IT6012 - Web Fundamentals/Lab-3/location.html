    <p>
      <strong>Select a desirable place for your house.</strong> There are many
      factors to consider when finding a suitable location on which to build
      your home. Think about a place you'd like to live long-term and keep in
      mind things like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Climate.</strong> Special considerations must be made for
        building in flood, hurricane, intense heat, frigid cold, and other
        extreme weather and climatic conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ground stability.</strong> Houses built on shifting sand, mucky
        soil, or other unstable earth will likely fail over a short period of
        time unless they are built on special foundations or pilings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability of utilities.</strong> If you intend to have
        electric power, potable water, telephone, and other conveniences, make
        sure these utility providers offer them at your location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community infrastructure.</strong> If you plan to raise children
        or have kids, make sure good quality schools are available. Check to see
        if you are in a police jurisdiction to protect you from crime, look at
        the distance you will have to travel to acquire basic commodities, and
        whether medical help is nearby.

    </ul>
