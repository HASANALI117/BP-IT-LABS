      <h1>The Suez Canal: History</h1>

      <h3>Beginnings</h3>
      <p class="first">
        In 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id
        Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct
        a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the
        canal for 99 years from its opening. The Suez Canal Company (Compagnie
        universelle du canal maritime de Suez) came into being on 15 December
        1858 and work started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April
        1859.

      <h3>Construction</h3>
      <p class="second">
        The excavation took some 10 years using forced labour (corvée) of
        Egyptian workers. Some sources estimate that over 30,000 people were
        working on the canal at any given period, that more than 1.5 million
        people from various countries were employed, and that thousands of
        labourers died.[

      <h3>Opening</h3>
      <p class="third">
        The canal opened under French control on 17 November 1869. Although
        numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome,
        the final cost was more than double the original estimate. The opening
        was performed by Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt and Sudan, and at
        Ismail's invitation French Empress Eugenie in the Imperial yacht Aigle
        piloted by Napoléon Coste, who was bestowed by the Khedive the Ottoman
        Order of the Medjidie. The first ship through the canal was the British
        P&O liner Delta.
