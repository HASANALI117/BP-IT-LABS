    <h3>Can I build my own house all by myself?</h3>
    <p>
      Only if you know exactly what you're doing; and it would take a very long
      time. It's a lot easier to hire a professional.
    </p>
    <h3>What is meant by a plan in relation to building a house?</h3>
    <p>
      A plan is the top view of the layout of your house. A rough plan will show
      only the location of the various rooms and their dimensions, with plumbing
      and lighting points marked. A detailed plan is used by the builder and
      shows the exact dimensions of the building so that everything built ties
      in neatly with everything else with no gaps or pieces sticking out.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Do you have to have a permit, and as an architect can I do it myself?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, a permit is almost always needed to build a house in most countries.
      If you feel that you're capable of designing the house yourself, of course
      you can do it. You'll need to check the local regulations on any
      requirements relating to the designer and certifications relevant to your
      qualifications.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do you need to choose good land?</h3>
    <p>
      The land is the foundation of the house and should reflect the quality of
      your home. If the land does not provide a strong, stable foundation for
      the house, it may be necessary to elevate the home on stilts or sink deep
      piles into the bedrock to support the floor slab. Alternatively, it may be
      possible to excavate the building site and use clean fill to create a
      properly compacted site.
    </p>
    <h3>What materials do I need?</h3>
    <p>
      It will depend on the house, as size, location and style all make a large
      difference. If you want to know what kind of materials you'll need, plan
      your house then work backwards -- once you know the specific measurements
      of what you want to build, then you can decide on materials. Otherwise,
      such a general question cannot be answered with any accuracy or ease.
