    Secure a construction loan. If you haven't already started this process when
    securing the land, you'll need to figure out a way to fund the project and a
    construction loan is the most recommended method of doing so. Apply for a
    construction loan by filling out a loan application, called a 1003, and
    submitting it to a loan officer along with a credit report.[5] The completed
    loan application will need to include information like:
    <ul>
      <li>The type of loan requested</li>
      <li>The amount of money requested</li>
      <li>Your current living situation</li>
      <li>Your social security number</li>
      <li>W-2 info</li>
    </ul>

      Get construction insurance. To engage in a homebuilding project, you'll
      need three types of construction-related insurance, some of which may be
      provided by the builder, some of which won't, depending on the state you
      live in and the nature of the contract you've signed. Typically, it's
      required that you provide: Course of Construction Insurance to cover
      against unforeseen loss including damages from fire, accident, vandalism
      and malicious mischief. General Liability Insurance is sometimes provided
      by the builder and sometimes not. It is a comprehensive liability coverage
      against accident on the workplace. You should only hire builders who
      provide this insurance themselves, as it can be quite expensive and could
      be indicative of shoddy workmanship if a builder doesn't provide it.
      Workman's Compensation Insurance is necessary if your builder hires their
      own workers. If the work is subcontracted (a common practice) you'll need
      to provide workman's comp and the builder must write a letter
      acknowledging that they do not have employees and will not provide
      compensation.

      Secure the proper construction permits. A building permit is a basic
      requirement in many areas, particularly for permanent construction. To
      obtain this, you'll need to provide detailed architectural diagrams,
      engineering load specs, and other materials to your state's Department of
      Housing. It's likely you'll also need the following to comply with local
      codes and zoning requirements by obtaining: A septic tank permit An
      electrical permit A plumbing permit A mechanical (HVAC, or air
      conditioning) permit You may also find you are required to apply for and
      receive an environmental and/or impact permit. Having the house location
      marked prior to obtaining your permits will help to work details out in
      the environmental permitting process.

      Prepare an Estimated Cost Breakdown (ECB). This is the breakdown of each
      particular cost of construction of the home. The foundation, lumber,
      framing, plumbing, heating, electrical, painting, and builder's profit,
      etc. When you hire a builder, they will usually complete this form to show
      you exactly what it will cost to build your new home. Price building
      materials in the area. How much is the cost of wood in the prospective
      area? Labor? Vinyl? It's helpful to give some though to how much the
      process will end up costing, aside from the land purchase itself. Try to
      get a rough estimate of how much it'll cost to build the kind of house you
      want to build at the location you're considering.

      Decide how much of the actual construction you will do yourself. Building
      a house involves several specific trades to ensure quality work, so it is
      usually better to have trained craftsmen perform things you're unable to
      do at an expert-level. You can probably paint the house and put up drywall
      yourself, but maybe you want to hire those jobs out. Try to find an
      economic and practical balance between doing projects yourself to save
      money and hiring out more intricate and difficult work. Consider hiring
      out: Site workers to clear and grade the land, prepping it for building
      Bricklayers to lay the foundation Framers to perform rough carpentry,
      frame up the walls, and install the trusses or stick-framed rafters
      Roofers to install the roof and insulate the house Electricians, plumbers,
      and HVAC workers to do the difficult interior work of outfitting the home
      for living Trim and finish carpenters for interior design work Flooring
      installers to lay the carpet, hardwood, or tile

      Consider hiring a builder on contract. Everything will be made easier if
      you hire an experienced builder to oversee the project. You won't need to
      worry about doing everything yourself, hiring out particular tasks, and
      securing the permits yourself. It's also much easier to secure a
      construction loan if you're working with an experienced builder who can
      include a statement, resume, banking and experience references, a line
      item cost breakdown of expected costs (an ECB), a materials list, and a
      construction contract.[6] The contract should include: The individual
      responsibilities of each party The expected date of the beginning and
      ending of the project The payment expected by the builder A completed
      Estimated Cost Breakdown (ECB), signed and dated Provisions for changes
